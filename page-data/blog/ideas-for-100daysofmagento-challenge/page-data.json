These will help you to choose the best one that enables you to learn Magento platform over the next 100 days. The challenge is not only for Magento developers, but for everyone who would like to participate and learn.</p>\n<p>I've been asked a couple of times \"If this a developer-only challenge\" or \"Can I participate?\". This post answers these questions and provides you with additional information to think about.</p>\n<h2>Most Frequent Questions</h2>\n<p>Here is the list of my answers to the most frequent questions I've received for the last 24 hours.</p>\n<h3>Is this a free challenge?</h3>\n<p>First of all, the #100DaysOfMagento challenge is FREE and you shouldn't pay anyone or sign-up for something in order to participate. You basically decide for yourself that you would like to learn about Magento 2 and you start. Along your journey to keep yourself motivated, you can share some of your results over Twitter with the #100DaysOfMagento hash tag.</p>\n<h3>How can I join the challenge?</h3>\n<p>In order to join, you just need to look and decide what area of Magento 2 is a grey one and tackle it. The thing is, only you are in charge of your knowledge and skills when it comes to Magento 2. If you want to know more, you allocate some time, in my case it is one hour a day, take some topic and learn. That's it.\nIf you want to share your results, feel free to jump and Tweet with the hash tag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfMagento\">#100DaysOfMagento</a>.</p>\n<h3>Do I need to learn only Magento 2.3.4 version?</h3>\n<p>No, absolutely no. You can pick any version, any area, any functionality and learn. You can even jump and see how Magento 2.0 works. I talked in the video that I am planning to work with Magento 2.3.4, but this is not a mandatory thing about the challenge.  </p>\n<h2>Ideas for Topics</h2>\n<p>Alright, the most interesting part of the post, I believe. What topics you should consider learning? The answer depends on the area you work and what exactly you would like to improve. For instance, I am a Magento 2 developer and I have a knowledge gap in Magento 2 message queue system. This is something I want to learn and practice. That's my number one goal for the challenge. It could take a week or two to find out how to use and where to use the message queue functionality, but this is something I want to get a better idea.</p>\n<p>Also, you have to consider your current level of experience with Magento 2. If you are new to Magento. Let's say you are coming from a PHP world and this is your first time, it is better to start with the basics. A good thing would be to familiarize yourself with <a href=\"/courses/magento-2-beginner\">Magento 2 basics</a> and then from there check what possible small features you can go and work with.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the ideas you can think of to practice development skills:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to install Magento 2 on the local environment?</li>\n<li>How to write a Magento 2 module?</li>\n<li>What is a Controller?</li>\n<li>What is a Model?</li>\n<li>How does the routing system works in Magento 2?</li>\n<li>What technology stack is used and how to configure it locally?</li>\n<li>How to customize a theme in Magento 2?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are a seasoned developer it is also great to consider these topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is Mview in MySQL and how it works with Magento 2?</li>\n<li>How to debug indexers in Magento 2?</li>\n<li>How to improve performance and where to look at in Magento 2?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For non-developers, let's say you are a Merchant, it could be something like the above:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to configure tax for my Magento 2 store?</li>\n<li>How to enable and configure the payment method in Magento 2?</li>\n<li>How can catalog and cart rules be used?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I hope you get the idea. You can learn anything in Magento 2, the most important is that it can help you in your career.\n</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/ideas-for-100daysofmagento-challenge","title":"Ideas for #100DaysOfMagento Challenge","date":"January 16, 2020","author":"Max Pronko","tags":["magento","100DaysOfMagento"],"featured_image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7777777777777777,"src":"/static/58f17caa21a960b0ba940c83405cef00/a54c6/ideas.png","srcSet":"/static/58f17caa21a960b0ba940c83405cef00/59beb/ideas.png 200w,\n/static/58f17caa21a960b0ba940c83405cef00/c0bbd/ideas.png 400w,\n/static/58f17caa21a960b0ba940c83405cef00/a54c6/ideas.png 800w,\n/static/58f17caa21a960b0ba940c83405cef00/9911c/ideas.png 1200w,\n/static/58f17caa21a960b0ba940c83405cef00/8f517/ideas.png 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
